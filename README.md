# Using BOX Python APIs
Repository accompanying the Blog Post on BOX API usage

This repository contains files used in a blog post on using the [BOX Python APIs](). The intention is to provide a starting point for developers who
want quickly get up and running with BOX Python APIs. <br>

While BOX has documentation here [Box API Documentation](https://developer.box.com/guides/tooling/sdks/python/), a lot is assumed to be known about the API in my humble opinion.

The following functions are included for demonstration purposes:

- box_utils - utility functions for the blog post
    - get_authenticated_client
    - create_box_folder
    - download_file_from_box
    - upload_file_to_box

Usage:
The scripts are meant to be just imported into your current projects for quick use as needed, nothing fancy. The functions are all in the box_utils module.

For a more in-depth review of the same concepts, please visit the repo linked here --> [Link](https://github.com/marcelkore/box-python-sdk)


Please review the blog post for more information on how to use the functions.
